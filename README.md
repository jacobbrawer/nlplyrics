Our group members include: Jacob Brawer, Owen Rosebeck, and Will Abele. The title of our intended project is "Popular Song Lyric Analysis from 1970-2019".
 
Are there certain words or types of words in lyrics that increase a song's presence in the Billboard Top 100? How have "popular" lyrics changed over time from 1970 to 2019? What are the lyrical characteristics of popular songs over the past 50 years? To explore these research questions, we scraped the Billboard Top 100 songs from the past 50 years and used the Genius API to give each Top 100 song its song lyrics.

Then, using Natural Language Processing, regular expression analysis, sentiment analysis, TF-IDF, and LDA Clustering, we analyze (over time) popular words, significant sentiments, lyric diversity and density, and important concepts and topics in R and Python.

Our song data were scraped come from billboards.com and billboardtop100of.com, which output strings and characters, which we match to lyrics using Genius. The Billboard Top 100 data comes with variables such as song (string), artist (string), Year (integer), rank (integer), and album (string).
 
As a final product, we put forth a myriad of visualizations and models to create a framework for analyzing popular song lyrics and a model that can apply that framework in order to analyze song popularity patterns based on the Billboard Top 100. We also use the lyric analyses to make conclusions about the time periods the songs come from.

For more information or questions for Jacob, Owen, or Will, feel free to email them at jacob.brawer@pomona.edu, owen.rosebeck@pomona.edu, and george.abele@pomona.edu, respectively.

We would like to thank Professor Jo Hardin, Professor of Mathematics at Pomona College, and Hadley Wickham, RStudio God, for their guidance and support with this project.
 
We're really excited about this project!
